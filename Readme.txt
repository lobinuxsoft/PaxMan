This is the PaxMan project, a straight reproduction of original Pac-Man Arcade game, the programmer assigned to the project has quit due to personal reasons and we need someone to finish his work.
He wasn't the best programmer either and I'm not sure he knew how to use unity properly, so the project is poorly implemented, inefficient and bugged, perhaps he would have cleaned it up in the polish period of the project?

We have no other resources nor the time to start from scratch, so please finish the original designed logic, fix bugs, improve performance and if you can improve code and project design. We don't have any artists either so if there are any missing assets, see what you can do.
Don't worry about audio, we have another guy for that.
Please locate a game design document as reference for the classic Pac-Man version to follow in your work and provide a link or copy along with your updated project.
